                     activities have the chance to digress into other addictive online activities at times when it comes to kids. Excess of 
                     anything is dangerous; therefore, investing too much time can harm the kids.

                          the pandemic’s early days. It lowers the distance between learning locations. There are a lot of advantages as well as 
                          disadvantages to online classes. It is a versatile method of learning which helps connect with people from various parts 
                          of the globe, which was not possible in offline classes. Students were given their comfort zone to study, resulting in 
                          better performance and productivity. It reduced a lot of paperwork, ultimately saving mother earth. Many renowned

                             <p>As we all know, a paragraph is a group of sentences that are connected and make absolute sense.
                                 While writing a long essay or letter, we break them into paragraphs
                                 for better understanding and to make a well-structured writing piece. Paragraph writing on any
                                  topic is not only about expressing your thoughts on the given topic, but it is also about framing
                                   ideas about the topic and making it convenient for the readers to follow it. In English paragraph 
                                   writing, it is essential to focus on the writing style, i.e., the flow and connection between the 
                                   sentences.
                               <br>
                                Therefore, a paragraph must be written in simple language in order to avoid any 
                                interruption while reading. In order to write a paragraph on any topic, you can refer 
                                to the samples given below and write a paragraph without any hindrance.</p>
